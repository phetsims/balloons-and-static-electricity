# Balloons and Static Electricity model

This document describes the model for Balloons and Static Electricity.<br>
@author Jesse Greenberg

The model in this simulation has been implemented such that the motion between two charged objects feels like<br>
F = kq<sub>1</sub>q<sub>2</sub>/r<sup>2</sup><br>

where:
F = applied force, N/m<br>
k = coulombs constant, N m<sup>2</sup>/C<sup>2</sup><br>
q<sub>1</sub> = charge of object 1, C<br>
F<sub>2</sub> = charge of object 2, C<br>
r = distance between objects, m<br>

<b>NOTE:</b>
However, a "true" physical model is not used in this sim, and liberties are taken so that the motion of the balloons
looks nice and feels like the Java version.<br>

For instance, constant k is 0.1 when calculating forces between the balloon and the sweater, and 10000 when calculating
the forces between the balloon and the wall. In addition, the force between objects is actually calculated with<br>

F = kq<sub>1</sub>q<sub>2</sub>/r<sup>3</sup><br>

so that the acceleration of the balloon is exaggerated. For more details on the implementation of this simulation,
